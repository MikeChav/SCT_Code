= Requirements =

- Python 3 <https://www.python.org/>

= Instructions =

$ make all

will reproduce all examples. These are stored as JSON files, each having a field 
"V" that is a list of lists. Each list should be interpreted as a linear order 
of the candidates, i.e., a vote.

Sample files are provided in the examples folder, and each generated example
should match the "C" and "V" fields of its corresponding sample file.
